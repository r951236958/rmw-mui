This project was bootstrapped with [NWB](https://github.com/insin/nwb).

Here is an article that should explain what `rmw-shell`is about and why it was made for: [Beyond create-react-app (CRA)](https://codeburst.io/beyond-create-react-app-cra-a2063196a124)

This is a `shell` for applications that can work with zero config and that can be updated with npm for bugfixes and new features. It provides a shell for applications that want to use react, redux, material-ui and firebase.

You can find an example of this project in this [DEMO](https://www.react-most-wanted.com/) ([Source code](https://github.com/TarikHuber/react-most-wanted)).

[DOCUMENTATION](https://github.com/TarikHuber/rmw-shell/wiki)

I tried to make the project as clean as possible and to use all libraries in their pure ways.

The fast way to use this library is to use CRA:
```json

npx create-react-app test-app --scripts-version rmw-react-scripts

```
